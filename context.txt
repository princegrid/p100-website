 This section includes:

These names are all visible under the survivor icons . (For example, Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake,
 Nea, Bill appear at the top of the list , and names like Gabriel Soma, Nicolas Cage, Ellen Ripley
 appear near the bottom .) 
Thus the Survivors section mirrors the Killers section: a heading, description, and a list of all survivor
 characters as text under icons.

Killer P100 Pages (Example)
 Each killer icon links to a P100 page for that character. For example, the P100 Trapper page has: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
18

 16
 A sub-heading “P100 TRAPPER” (an H3 heading) . 
An image credit line “Art by: Emilu” above the content . 
Introductory text: “Welcome on the P100 Trapper page. Here, you will find the list, as well as
 multiple artwork/renders made by wonderful artists. Click on the image to go to the artist’s page
 directly. You can also see their name below each fanart. Reminder that it isn’t ordered! You can

 ind links at the bottom of the page to contact me…” . 
The list of players: It shows “The P100 Trapper list starts here:” and then a bullet list of player
 names, e.g. PallyStream, Mikaelanator, NativeManiax, etc.

 plain text.)

 . (All names in that list are visible as
 In general, each killer’s P100 page follows this same pattern: a heading “P100 [KillerName]”, optional
 artist credit (“Art by …”), a welcome paragraph, and then “The P100 [KillerName] list starts here:”
 followed by a bullet list of many player names. We have examined Trapper’s page as an example
 . Other killer pages (Wraith, Hillbilly, Nurse, etc.) have the same structure with their respective
 names and lists. 
Survivor P100 Pages (Example)
 19
 Similarly, each survivor icon links to a P100 page for that survivor. For example, the P100 Dwight page
 includes: 
• 
• 
• 
20
 A heading “P100 dwight” . 
Intro text: “Welcome on the P100 Dwight page. Here, you will find the list, as well as multiple
 artwork/renders made by wonderful artists. Click on the image to go to the artist’s page directly.
 You can also see their name below each fanart. Reminder that it isn’t ordered! You can find links
 at the bottom of the page to contact me…” . 
The P100 list: It states “The P100 Dwight list starts here:” and then lists dozens of player names
 (e.g. shogunthesebaals, Tre, Ryxn9001YT, … Ozi) as bullet items . 
21

 23
 All survivor P100 pages follow this format. In each case, the content consists of the heading (“P100
 [Name]”), a short introduction with instructions, and then a bullet list of player names. For brevity we
 cite Dwight’s page as representative , noting that every character (both killers and survivors) has
 a similar P100 page. 
22
 Credits Page
 The Credits section is at the bottom (linked via “Credits” in the nav). It contains: 
• 
• 
• 
24
 A heading “CREDITS <3” . 
A fanart image credit (e.g. “Art by zmpixie”)
 25
 26
 and another image credit . 
A welcome note from the creator: “Hello! Thank you for coming to the credits section. I, the one
 who came up the idea of this website, and made it, am ~~steve~~ Slender. A variety streamer... I
 was of course not alone on this. A lot of people, players, artists, and friends helped me. Even if I
 was the one to write down the names... Everything you see... would not be there without them.”
 This paragraph continues on about artists’ credits .

 A thank-you list: The page lists individuals by name who helped with each character’s list (e.g.
 “Witheringspark, for the Cheryl list; VeriHiHi, for the Leon list; YoichiBear, for the Yoichi list; …
 Brandyn, for the Unknown list; etc.”) . 
Social links: At the very bottom, it shows icons labeled “Discord server” and “X” (formerly
 Twitter). The text says: “Links of my social networks, if you wish to contact me about anything on
 this site:” followed by bullet icons for Discord and X .

 In short, the Credits page is headed “CREDITS <3” and contains thank-you text and contributor names
 as shown above
 , plus links to the creator’s Discord and X accounts . 
29
 Navigation: The site uses anchor links for navigation. The top menu’s Home, Killers, Survivors, Credits
 items scroll the page to the corresponding section. Each killer/survivor icon acts as a link (anchor) to
 that character’s P100 section on the same page. All text (headings, instructions, names, buttons) on
 each section/page is as described above and is cited from the site.
