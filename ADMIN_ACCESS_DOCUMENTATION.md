# Admin Panel Access Documentation

## Secure Admin Panel Migration

The admin panel has been moved to a secure, obscure URL with enhanced security features to protect against unauthorized access.

## New Admin Access Information

### URL Structure
- **Secure Admin URL**: `/admin-panel-x8k2m9p7`
- **Access URL**: `/admin-panel-x8k2m9p7?key=x8k2m9p7_secure_admin_access`

### Security Features

#### 1. URL Key Validation
- Admin panel requires a secret key parameter: `?key=x8k2m9p7_secure_admin_access`
- Without the key, the page returns a 404 error
- Key is validated against `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` environment variable

#### 2. Rate Limiting System
- **Maximum Login Attempts**: 5 failed attempts
- **Lockout Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Persistent Tracking**: Uses localStorage to track attempts across browser sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows remaining attempts and lockout countdown

#### 3. Old Route Protection
- Original `/admin` route now redirects to 404
- Prevents access to the old admin interface

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Admin password for accessing the admin dashboard  
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

# Secret key for accessing the admin panel via URL parameter
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=x8k2m9p7_secure_admin_access
```

## Access Instructions for Authorized Users

1. **Navigate to the secure URL**: 
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/admin-panel-x8k2m9p7?key=x8k2m9p7_secure_admin_access
   ```

2. **Login with admin password**: 
   - Use the password configured in `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - Default: `admin123` (change this in production!)

3. **Rate Limiting Information**:
   - You have 5 login attempts before lockout
   - Failed attempts are tracked and persist across browser sessions
   - After 5 failed attempts, account is locked for 15 minutes
   - A countdown timer shows remaining lockout time

## Security Benefits

1. **Obscure URL**: `/admin-panel-x8k2m9p7` is not easily guessable
2. **URL Key Requirement**: Additional layer requiring secret key parameter
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks with progressive lockout
4. **No Public References**: Admin functionality is completely hidden from public navigation
5. **404 on Old Route**: Original `/admin` route is disabled

## Important Notes

- **Change Default Values**: Update both the admin password and secret key in production
- **Keep URLs Secret**: Do not share the admin URL publicly
- **Regular Access**: Admin URL should only be bookmarked by authorized personnel
- **Environment Security**: Ensure `.env.local` is not committed to version control
